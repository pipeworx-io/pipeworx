# Pipeworx

**Live data for AI agents.** One MCP connection gives your AI access to 261 data sources and 961 tools — SEC filings, FDA adverse events, trade flows, mortgage rates, clinical trials, government contracts, and more.

Pipeworx is not a directory. It's a metered data gateway. The data sources behind it — ATTOM, FRED, SEC EDGAR, ClinicalTrials.gov, UN Comtrade, EPA, BLS — are the same sources analysts and institutions pay thousands to access. Your AI agent gets them through one URL.

## Connect

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pipeworx": {
      "url": "https://gateway.pipeworx.io/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and any MCP client.

## Ask anything

```
ask_pipeworx("What is the US trade deficit with China?")
→ $1.81 trillion deficit (2024, Census Bureau)

ask_pipeworx("What are the side effects of ozempic?")
→ 54,647 FDA adverse event reports

ask_pipeworx("Get Apple's latest 10-K filing")
→ SEC EDGAR filing data

ask_pipeworx("What's the current 30-year mortgage rate?")
→ FRED MORTGAGE30US series, live data
```

The gateway picks the right tool, fills the arguments, executes it, and returns the answer. No API keys, no schema matching, no setup.

## Compound tools

These combine multiple APIs into a single call — the kind of synthesis that normally takes an analyst 5+ individual queries:

```
trade_bilateral_analysis({ reporter_code: "842", partner_code: "156" })
→ US-China imports, exports, top commodities, exchange rates — one call

pharma_drug_profile({ drug_name: "ozempic" })
→ FDA approvals, adverse events, drug interactions, active clinical trials — one call

fintech_company_deep_dive({ ticker: "AAPL" })
→ SEC filings, stock quote, income statement, consumer complaints — one call
```
